        Have you, like the rest of the world, speculated as to the identity of
        Satoshi Nakamoto, anonymous creator of Bitcoin?
      </p>
      <p>
        The world's first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin went online in 2009 and has
        since revolutionized our concepts of currency and money. Not supported
        by any government or central bank, completely electronic, Bitcoin is a
        virtual currency based on advanced cryptographic systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the currency he created, the identity of Bitcoin's creator Satoshi
        Nakamoto is virtual, existing only online. The Nakamoto persona, which
        may represent an individual or a group, exists only in the online
        publications that introduced and explained Bitcoin during its earliest
        days. Here, collected and professionally published for the first time
        are the essential writings that detail Bitcoin's creation.
      </p>
      <p class="font-semibold">Included are:</p>
      <ul class="list-outside list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
          Satoshi Nakamoto Emails and Posts on Computer Forums Presented in
          Chronological Order
        </li>
        <li>Bitcoin Fundamentals Presented in Layman's Terms</li>
        <li>Bitcoin's Potential and Profound Economic Implications</li>
        <li>The Seminal Paper Which Started It All</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Book of Satoshi provides a convenient way to parse through what
        Bitcoin's creator wrote over the span of the two years that constituted
        his "public life" before he disappeared from the Internet ... at least
        under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Beginning on November 1st 2009 with the
        publication of the seminal paper describing Bitcoin, this public life
        ends at about the time PC World speculated as to a possible link between
        Bitcoin and WikiLeaks, the infamous website that publishes leaked
        classified materials. Was there a connection? You be the judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nakamoto's true identity may never be known. Therefore the writings
        reproduced here are probably all the world will ever hear from him
        concerning Bitcoin's creation, workings, and theoretical basis. Want to
        learn more about Bitcoin? Go directly to the source-the writings of the
        creator himself, Satoshi Nakamoto!

      <p>
        Phil Champagne is the author of the best selling books, "The Book of
        Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto"
        (1st edition published in 2014 and 2nd edition in 2025) and "Bitcoin vs
        Altcoins: The Battle for Dominance" (2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Book of Satoshi (1st edition) was the first English language book
        ever published about Bitcoin back in 2014. Since then The Book of
        Satoshi became a history book about Bitcoin translated into 7 languages
        and counting, and consistently referred to as one of the top 5 must read
        books on Bitcoin. Following Craig's Wright trial, new emails were
        released. This prompted Phil to write the 2nd edition and give us the
        most complete collection of Satoshi's writings up to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phil has a background in software engineering with a bachelor's degree
        in electrical engineering (University of Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec, Canada).
        He's also a seasoned real estate and precious metals investor with 20+
        years experience and is the managing director of Wren Investment Group.
        Guided by the Austrian School of Economics, he's been a strong advocate
        of Bitcoin since 2012.
